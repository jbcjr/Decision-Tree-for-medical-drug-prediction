# Decision Tree for medical drug prediction

In this project, the Decision Trees classification algorithm will be used to build a model from the historical data of patients and their response to different medications. After that, the trained decision tree will be used to predict the class of an unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.

Project based in IBM Decision Trees Lab for the course Machine Learning with Python, authored by Saeed Aghabozorgi with contributions from Joseph Santarcangelo
